The roasted beet salad was scrumptious, as was the meatball pasta entr√©e, and the salted caramel budino was a perfect dessert finisher. We came for restaurant week lunch and got a great value, though normal prices would be a bit higher. Overall a classy place for a nice meal out next time you're craving well-crafted Italian / Mediterranean food."

My risotto was too lemony, slightly bland and our duck was not full of flavor. The cheese platter was my favorite part of the meal. The drinks were pretty good, but I couldn't taste the alcohol in mine. I might try again but I was let down for sure.</br></br>It's also hard to find it as the sign is very small."

Dined here for both dinner and another time for cocktails at the bar. Service was mediocre at best- Unattentive waitstaff and disgruntled bartender. Food was forgettable at best, hard pass on the chicken.  Not sure how this place has good reviews, the food was greasy and overpriced and over presented. Feels like dining in 1998. And the acoustics were reason in itself to walk right out. A million better dining options in philly, don't waste your time at this forgettable spot."

Anytime I need a Crab Fix in the city I drop in here pick up a Jumbo Crab Roll, Blueberry Lemonade and side salad. It's Phenomenal. Take that lunch over to the park on a summer day and you have a completely immersive experience Please keep doing what your doing, its perfect."

As many people mention, the value isn't quite there, but I knew the price to size ratio was small going in so it wasn't too much of a concern. The problem is each roll was pretty mediocre. They all suffered from lack of seasoning. The shrimp roll had the best flavor profile, albeit a little fishy. The employees were nice, and picking up my order was simple enough. I doubt I'll return."

My wife and Son ate here 6 months ago and we're raving about it, so we went back, the menu was completely different, I had the cole slaw appetizer which was ok $11 guys it's cabbage, moving onto my chicken salad $20 very similar to a Outback house salad for $6 just add some gristly two day old chicken and you got it. I ate a few bites and left it, when the waitress finally came around to clear the table mentioned nothing about my untouched salad just proceeded to clear the table to get us out of there to reseat another party.

Flavor comes from the cheese/ toppings added, meat in general is not flavored as it relies on the whiz or provolone. That all being said bread is soft and standard, meat is chopped and mushrooms and provolone adds flavor to areas it touches"

The sound of thre frankford el whizzing by a total of 15 times during our $468.00 dinner for 4 , was ridiculous, we couldn't hold a coversation.along with some grade</br>A lack of class  from THIS DISGRACE OF A HOSTESS  is enough to make me stay away from here, even though our server Veronics was EXCELLENT.</br>This place is mediocre at best.</br>FOR LESS MONEY, WAY BETTER FOOD AND SERVICE. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO ZAHAV OR LAZAR WOLF INSTEAD.</br></br>This place is not worth your money when we have better options in this city, Even during covid dining."
