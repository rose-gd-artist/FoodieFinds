The roasted beet salad was scrumptious, as was the meatball pasta entr√©e, and the salted caramel budino was a perfect dessert finisher. We came for restaurant week lunch and got a great value, though normal prices would be a bit higher. Overall a classy place for a nice meal out next time you're craving well-crafted Italian / Mediterranean food."
